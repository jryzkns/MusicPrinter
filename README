Distributed Music Printer
=========================

The distributed music printer consists of several components.

1. 'lpr-music' is a command line tool that accepts music through standard input 
and plays the music on local speaker instances.

2. 'speakerd' is the distributed speaker system that runs on each device that 
will play music.  Each instance continuously synchronizes the clock against all 
other instances.  The lpr-music command sends each instance of speakerd the 
song to play then requests playback.

3. To implement a shared playlist we will connect lpr-music to the UNIX print 
spooler lpr.  Using the standard commands lpr, lpq, and lprm we can manage a 
shared playlist among all users.

Getting Started
===============

Install dependencies

 - FDK-AAC: AAC Decoder/Encoder

Build the software with the 'scons' command.

% scons

You can clean the build with:

% scons -c

Printer Setup
=============

See printcap(5), lpd(8) for setup and lpr(1)/lpq(1),lprm(1) for usage.

We need to create a new printer on the machine and point it to our lpr-music 
program.  See the fields lp, sd, if, af, lf, and sh in the printcap file.
