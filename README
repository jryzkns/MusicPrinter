Distributed Music Printer
=========================

The distributed music printer consists of several components.

1. 'lpr-music' is a command line tool that accepts music through standard input 
and plays the music on local speaker instances.

2. 'speakerd' is the distributed speaker system that runs on each device that 
will play music.  Each instance continuously synchronizes the clock against all 
other instances.  The lpr-music command sends each instance of speakerd the 
song to play then requests playback.

3. To implement a shared playlist we will connect lpr-music to the UNIX print 
spooler lpr.  Using the standard commands lpr, lpq, and lprm we can manage a 
shared playlist among all users.
